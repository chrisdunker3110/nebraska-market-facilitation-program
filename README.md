 In July 2018, the USDA announced a "Market Facilitation Program" designed to offset farmers' losses due to the trade war.  On August 23, I filed a Freedom of Information Act Request for all payments made to Nebraska producers from Sept. 7, 2018 to Aug. 23, 2019. The USDA provided the requested documents on Sept.  9, 2019. The data shows Nebraska farmers have received nearly $694 million in payments during the first year of the program. Using R, I have analyzed the payments by Nebraska's 93 counties.
